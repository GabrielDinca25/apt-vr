# APT VR - Anxiety and Phobia Treatment in Virtual Reality

APT VR is a Virtual Reality software developed using Unity for the [Valve Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex) VR Headset. 

The purpose of APT VR is to support phobia treatment using Systematic Desensitization which involves gradually exposing patients to triggering stimuli in order to help those who have difficulty imagining anxiety-evoking scenes. It currently supports scenes used for exposing patients to phobias such as fear of heights, fear of the dark, fear of spiders or fear of enclosed spaces.

The software is meant for both adults and children, providing different stimuli levels and scenes for each of them and the ability for the user and for the therapist to adjust the said stimuli levels while the software is running and interactively.

APT VR is a student-made project and has not yet been tested by real anxiety patients or therapists.
